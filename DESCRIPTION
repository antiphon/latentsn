Title: Latent Shot-noise Risk Field Estimation For Binary Marked Point Patterns
Authors: 
    Tuomas Rajala <tuomas.rajala@iki.fi>
Version: 0.1
Description: The package implements a custom MCMC algorithm for estimating a model for a binary-marked point pattern, where marking probability is given by a 
  shot-noise field with a very specific shape that models the risk from the spreading of root-rot inducing fungus via root-systems of spruces.
